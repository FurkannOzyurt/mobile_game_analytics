## üìä Project Overview

This project is divided into three main parts:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Cohorted and daily KPIs:  
     - Daily Active Users (DAU)  
     - Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)  
     - Average Revenue Per Daily Active User (ARPDAU)  
     - Retention rates  
     - Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)  
   - Key findings, positive and negative trends, and action suggestions.

2. **A/B Testing**  
   - Evaluation of two experimental groups using:  
     - Monetization metrics  
     - Engagement metrics  
   - Statistical tests to decide which variant performs better.

3. **Predictive Modeling**  
   - Objective: Predict whether a user will make a purchase within 30 days based on their first 7 days of activity.  
   - Includes:  
     - Data preparation & cleaning  
     - Feature engineering  
     - Model selection & training  
     - Model evaluation & validation
